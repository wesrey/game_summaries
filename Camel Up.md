# Camel Up
## How to Win
Have the most money (coins) at the end of the race. No tie breaker.
The instant one camel has crossed the finish line, conduct final scoring and see who won.

## Setup
**Give each player** 3 coins and matching set of 5 cards, one of each camel color.
**On board,** put 5 pyramid tiles and each camel's three "betting leg" tiles (2, 3, then 5 on top) tiles.
Put 5 camels, side by side, at the starting line.
Game says youngest player starts.

## Camel Positions
Camel in front is ahead; Camel on top is ahead.

## Racing Legs
### Player Turn, Choose One:
1. Place (or move) their Desert tile on the track
	- Cannot go on spot 1 (art here indicates this)
	- Cannot go in spot neighboring another desert tile
	- Cannot go in spot containing a camel
	- Be aware the tile has 2 different sides (+1 and -1 sides)
2. Roll a Die from Pyramid
	- Pick up a pyramid tile (guaranteed coin at end of leg scoring) and roll one die.
	- That color camel moves its stack. On top if sharing a spot. Put the die on the colored tent on the board.
	- If they land on a +1 "oasis" tile, pay tile owner, the camel stack goes forward and ON TOP.
	- If they land on a -1 "mirage" tile, pay tile owner, the camel stack goes backward and UNDER.
3. Pick up a Leg Betting Tile
	- Tiles are a bet for a camel to be first (5 coins) or second (1 coin).
	- 3rd-5th place lose 1 coin.
4. Put down a card in the Overall Last Place or Overall First Place piles
	- Put a camel card from their hand in either pile

### End of Racing Leg Scoring
Once all 5 dice have been rolled, score the leg.
Pay leg bet and pyramid tiles now; players cannot go less than zero coins.
Put all betting tiles back. Take all desert tiles back.
Play continues from player after whoever rolled the last die that caused the scoring leg.

## End Game Scoring
Do one final Leg Scoring.
Finally, score Overall First Place and Overall Last Place card piles.
Remember, bottom cards deserve the higher payouts (amounts shown on flags on board).
Correct bets always will end up "paying out" at least 1 coin (last green checkmark flag on board).
Incorrect bets will always result in loss of 1 coin (red X flag on board).
