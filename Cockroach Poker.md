# Cockroach Poker
## How to Win
Lose (and all others Win) if:
- 4-bugs-of-a-kind displayed in front of you.
- Need to play a card, but hand is empty.

## Setup
Deal all cards to every player. Some might get one more than others.

## Rounds, Player Turns
1. Player chooses a bug card from hand and offers it face down to any other player.
2. Offering player says aloud what bug is on the card. This is either True or a Lie.
Receiving Player can either:
	- Look at card (unless everyone else has already seen it) and goto 2.
	- OR Announce offering player is Lying or telling the Truth.
		- If Receiving Player is correct, the Offering Player keeps the card in front of them.
		- Else, Receiving Player keeps card in front of them.
Receiving Player, right or wrong, leads next round (goto 1).
