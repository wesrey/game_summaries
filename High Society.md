# High Society
## How to Win
Auction ends Immediately when 4th Green Card is flipped up for bid.
Once auction is over: Winner has (a) Most points AND (b) NOT the poorest player.
### Tiebreaker
Player with most money left wins.
Then, Highest single Luxury Card value wins.

## Setup
- Each player takes their set of 11 color-matched money cards as their hand
- Randomly select starting player
- Shuffle the 16 larger cards together to make the draw deck
	- Luxury Possession Cards: 10 cards worth face value (1-10)
	- Recognition Cards: 3 cards that will x2 double your score
	- Misfortune Cards: 3 cards that will:
		- 1/2 halve your score
		- -5 your score (before multiplying halves or doubles)
		- Force you to discard a Luxury Possession Card immediately or as soon as you get one (remove these two cards from game once this is done)

## Rounds
1. Flip top card of deck Face Up
	- If a Luxury (1-10) or Recognition (x2) card, all OTHER players must Pass for you to Win the card	
	- If a Misfortune Card, players bid to NOT Win the card.
		- The FIRST player to Pass "Wins" the bad card (ALL others still pay)

### Player Turn
#### Bid
1. Play *one or more* money cards face up.
2. Played cards must add up to MORE than current highest bid.
3. If bidding with money cards already in front of you, ONLY ADD cards
	- NO "making change" with cards in hand.
#### OR Pass
- Take face-up money cards BACK into hand.
- You will either sit out the rest of bidding, or end the round if it's a Misfortune Card

### Round End?
#### Luxury (1-10) or Recognition (x2) cards:
- If *everyone else* has passed (and taken back their Money Cards), last final remaining bidder is Winner.
#### Misfortune cards:
- If *anyone has passed* that passer "Wins" immediately.
- Players with bids in front of them *all* spend their bids.
#### Winner takes the Card and Starts Next
- Winner puts the Card they won face up on front of them.
- Money cards spent by bidders are removed from the game.
- Flip top card from Draw Deck and previous round Winner Starts Bidding

### Game End
When the 4th Green-Bordered card is revealed from the Draw Deck, the game ends immediately.
No bidding will take place for this 4th Green card.
